# Shearing and Bending Moment Diagram / Calculator Project

## To Do:

### Note: Code will be refactored, currently very messy

- [x] Allow user to specify Beam Length
- [ ] Allow user to specify Beam Properties (Younge's Modulus, Moment of Inertia about the Z direction)
- [x] Allow user to specify type of Support (Pin, Roller, Fixed)
- [ ] Allow user to specify location of Support
- [ ] Allow user to specify Point Load Direction, Location and Magnitude
- [ ] Allow user to specify Moment Direction, Location and Magnitude
- [ ] Allow user to specify Distributed Load
  - [x] Convert from a Distributed Load to a Point Load
- [ ] Allow user to specific Hinge and Hinge Location
